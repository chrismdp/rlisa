=RLISA=

rLisa is an image approximation engine written in ruby. It uses polygons to render images and genetic algorithms to successively improve the approximation of the target image.

The idea is shamelessly stolen from:

Code is MIT-licensed. 

=RUNNING=

Prerequisite: OpenGL
$ sudo gem install ruby-opengl

You'll also need a copy of RMagick installed.

To run:

$ ruby -rubygems ga-polygons.rb <target image>

=WISHLIST=

* Polygon ordering genes
* Multiple side polygon genes
* Better fitness function using fourier transforms?
* Better factoring of genetic algorithms from rendering
* Ability to plug in fitness functions and breeding functions
* Dominant/Recessive genes?
